# flutter_customerfeedback_api


2 Seperate projects created 
---------------------------
1. Created .net 8 RESTFUL web api in visual studio
     - CRUD created for full interaction with DB/swagger and flutter ap
     -   Code first approach
     -   Interaction with swagger "insert/delete/search" all working
     -   Authentication for login screen created but login screen not finished [time constraint due to current projects]
     -   Linq interaction with db working perfect
     -   
  
2. Created flutter front end app
     - Customerfeedback screen created
     - serch user created
     - add feeed with name, email, customerfeedback
     - email authentication created but sendgrid gives an error after signing up and trying to navigate the site(multiple email signups all get error)
     - OneSignal email auth created - few issues, current app gives issues, but on seperate app emails are being sent[figure out why]
  
3. Challenges
     - Personal machine is an i5, so machine boms out connecting to firebase features/onesignal as well
     - outstanding items = Login authentication + email sender
